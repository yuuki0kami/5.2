# Deep Hedging
## Reinforcement Learning for Hedging Derviatives under Market Frictions

This archive contains a sample implementation of of the [Deep Hedging framework](http://deep-hedging.com). The purpose of the code base is to illustrate the concepts behind Deep Hedging. The code is not optimized for speed. Any production use will require additional safeguards before use.

The notebook directory has a number of examples on how to use it. 

### Latest major updates:

* **Recurrent Agents** (Feb 12th 2023): improved recurrent network definition by supporting LSTM/GRU-like recurrent states. A summary of the recurrent states supported is provided [here](Network.md).

* **Notebooks** (Feb 12th 2023): upgraded  `notebooks/trainer-recurrent-fwdstart.ipynb` which shows the performance of the recurrent networks vs the non-recurrent default in the case of a forward started option.

----

* **Notebooks** (Jan 29th, 2023):
    * Added `notebooks/trainer-bs.ipynb` showing convergence of the Deep Hedging strategy vs Black & Scholoes. 
    * Added `notebooks/trainer-recurrent-fwdstart.ipynb` which shows the improved (but not perfect) performance of recurrent networks vs standard feed forward networks for forward started options.
    * Added `notebooks/utility0.ipynb` which illustrates various monetary utilities.

* **Initial Delta Hedge** (Jan 29th, 2023): by default an additional agent is created which learns an initial delta hedge. This is useful when the `payoff` provided is not yet hedged, and therefore when the initial hedge differs materially from subsequent hedges. This can be turned off with `config.gym.agent.init_delta.active = False`.

* **Optimiers** (Jan 29th, 2023): upgraded the code so optimizers can be controlled more tightly. The code also now uses TF 2.10 style optimizers.
You can now write
    ```
    config.trainer.train.optimizer.name = "adam"
    config.trainer.train.optimizer.learning_rate = 0.001
    config.trainer.train.optimizer.clipvalue = 1.
    config.trainer.train.optimizer.global_clipnorm = 1.
    ```

* **TensorFlow loops** (Jan 29th, 2023): the code no longer unrolls the core Deep Hedging loop, but uses `tf_while` implicitly. This helps preserving memory when many time steps are used.

* **GPU speed up** (Jan 29th, 2023): the new code base benefits much more from the presence of a GPU than the old version, when large sample sizes are used. The notebook `notebooks/trainer-recurrent-fwdstart.ipynb` runs twice as fast on GPUs. Further optimization should be possible.

* **TensorBoard** (Jan 29th, 2023): added support for TensorBoard. See `notebooks/trainer-board.ipynb`. However, I did not manage to make it run on SageMaker, neither did I manage to run the profiler on my own machine.

* **Visualization Update** (Jan 29th, 2023): improved visualization during training by adding a view on spot delta and actions, and by adding several views which include the stddev from the mean per plotted bin.  Also added better information on network setup and features used.

----

* **Enabled caching** (Jan 8th, 2023): by default, the code now caches progress every 10 epochs. Training will be picked up at the last caching point when the same code is re-run. If training completed, running the same code again will not trigger new training; you can set `config.train.caching.mode = 'update'`.

* **Recurrent Agents** (Jan 8th, 2023): 
 the trading agent can now pass on a state from one step to another, allowing full recurrence.

### Deep Hedging


The Deep Hedging problem for a horizon $T$ hedged over $M$ time steps with $N$ hedging instruments is finding an optimal *action* function $a$ as a function of feature states $s_0,\ldots,s_{T-1}$ which solves

$$
 \sup_a:\ \mathrm{U}\left[\ 
    Z_T + \sum_{t=0}^{T-1} a(s_t) \cdot DH_t + \gamma_t \cdot | a(s_t) H_t |
 \ \right] \ .
$$

Here
* $s_t$ is the *state* of the market; in other words it is a vector of $t$-observable variables which are fed as parameters into our action network $a$.
* $H_t$ is the vector of market mid-price of the $N$ hedging instruments available at $t$.
* $\gamma_t$ is the vector of proportional transaction cost.
* $DH_t$ denotes the vector of returns holding the $N$ hedging instruments available at time $t$ until some maximum expiry $T'\geq T$. 
    * If the $i$<b></b>th hedging instrument is spot $S$, then  $DH^{i}_t = S_T - S_t$ is simply the return of the equity from $t$ to $T$.
    * If the $i$<b></b>th instrument is an option $X$ with expiry $\tau$ then in the current implementation uses $DH^{i}_t = X_\tau - V_t$ where $V$ is the market price at $t$ and where $X_\tau$ is the option's payoff at maturity. The maturity $T'$ is the maximum off all maturities of all hedging instruments.
    An alternative would be to use $DH^{i}_t := V_T - V_t$, e.g. using the market mid-price at time $T$ for the return calculation whenever $\tau> T$.

* $U$ is a _monetary utility_ which can be thought of as a risk-adjusted return.
A classic example is the entropy, given by $U(X) := - \frac1\lambda \log\ \mathrm{E}\left[\ \exp(-\lambda X) \right] $. The code base supports a number of utility-based monetary utilities which can be found in `objectives.py`.

To test the code run `notebooks/trainer.ipynb`.


In order to run the Deep Hedging, we require:

* __Market data__: this is referred to as a `world`. The sample code provides a simplistic default implementation: a simple Black & Scholes world, and a made up stochastic volatility world. The notebook `notebooks/simpleWorld_Spot_ATM.ipynb` provides some visualization.        
        For any real application it is recommend to rely on fully machine learned market simulators, c.f. https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.06823.

    A `world` class contains a number of members. The most important are

    * `tf_data` member which contains

        * `tf_data['features']['market']`: core market data for the simulator. These are _not_ passed as features $s_t$ to the action model, because some of them such as $DH_t$ are forward looking.

        * `tf_data['features']['per_step']`: features per time step $t$, e.g. current equity spot, prices for out options, time left, implied vol, values of the boundaries for actions.
        * `tf_data['features']['per_path']`: features per sample path. These are currently none as we are training for fixed instruments, but this can be extended accordingly.

        Note that the actual features $s_t$ available for training are a combination of the above and live features. The list of available features are printed out before training starts. To obtain a list of supported features, call

        * `VanillaDeepHedgingGym.available_features_per_step` for the features available per time step, i.e. $s_t$ in above formulation. Call `agent_features_used` to assess which features were actually used by the agent.

        * `VanillaDeepHedgingGym.available_features_per_path` for the features available per sample path step. This is a subset of $s_0$. This is used for the OCE monetary utilities. Call `utilitiy_features_used` to assess which features were actually used.

    * `tf_sample_weights` the probability distribution across samples. If you compute any summary statisics, do not forget to refer to this distribution. As an example `base.py`
    contains a number of basic stats functions such as `mean` and `std` which do not assume a uniform distribution.
    

* __Gym__: the main Keras custom model. It is a Monte Carlo loop arund the actual underlying `agent.py` networks which represents $a$ in the formula above. Given a `world` object we may compute the loss given the prevailing action network as `gym(world.tf_data)`.

* __Train__: some cosmetics around `keras.fit()` with some nice live visualization of our training progress using matplotlib if you are in jupyter. See discussion below.

To provide your own world with real or simulator data, see `world.py`.
Here are `world.tf_data` entries used by `gym.call()`:

* `data['market']['payoff'](:,)`: the payoff $Z_T$ at maturity. Since this is at the time of the expiry of the product, this can be computed off the path until $T$. No derivative pricing model is required.

* `data['martket']['hedges'](:,M,N)`: returns of the hedges, i.e. the vector $DH_t:=H_{T'} - H_t$ for each time step. That means $H_t$ is the market price at time $t$, and $H_{T'}$ is payoff of the instrument at its expiry. In our examples we expand the timeline such that the expiry of all products is part of the market simulator. 

    For example, if $S_t$ is spot, $w_t^{(i)}$ is the option's implied volatility at $t$,  $x$ its time-to-maturity, and $k$ a relative strike, then
$$
    H_t^{(i,t)} = \mathrm{BSCall}( S_t, w^{(i)}_t; T, kS_t ) \ \ \ \mathrm{and} \ \ \ H_{T'}^{(i,t)} = ( S_{t+x} - kS_t )^+
$$

* `data['martket']['cost'](:,M,N)`: cost $\gamma_t$ of trading the hedges in $t$ for proportional cost $c_t(a) = \gamma_t\cdot |a|$.  
More advanced implementations allow to pass the cost function itself as a tensorflow model.
In the simple setting an example for the cost of trading a vanilla call could be $\gamma_t = \gamma^D\, \Delta(t,\cdots)+ \gamma^V\,\mathrm{BSVega}(t,\cdots)$.

* `data['martket']['unbd_a'],data['martket']['lnbd_a'](:,M,N)`: min/max allowed action (change of delta) per time step: $a^\mathrm{min}_t \leq a \leq a^\mathrm{max}_t$, componenwise. Note that the min/max values can be path dependent. In the current implementation they will not depend on dynamic states (such as the current position in hedges), but this can be added if required.

* *`data['features']['per_step'](:,M,N)`: featues for feeding the action network per time step such as current spot, current implied volatilities, time of the day, etc. Those will be added to the state vector $s_t$.

* `data['features']['per_sample'](:,M)`: featues for feeding the action network which are constant along the path such as features of the payoff, risk aversion, etc. This is not used in any of the current examples, but it will allow you to train the model for different payoffs at the same time:

    * Define different option payoffs $Z_T$ per path
    * Enure that the characteristic of the option payoff are part of the `per_sample` feature set, and that they are picked up by the respective network agent. See [our paper on learning for different payoffs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.07467) as an example.

An example world generator for simplistic model dynamics is provided, but in practise it is recommend to rely on fully machine learned market simulators such as https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.06823

## Installation

See `requirements.txt` for latest version requirements. At the time of writing this markdown these are
* Use Python 3.7 or later
* Pip (or conda) install `cdxbasics` version 0.2.9 or higher
* Install `cvxpy`
* Install TensorFlow 2.7 or higher, ideally 2.10 or better.
* Install tensorflow_probability 0.15 or higher, c.f. https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/tensorflow-probability. 

    <small>Deep Hedging uses `tensorflow-probability` which does _not_ provide a robust dependency to the installed TensorFlow version. If you receive an error you will need to make sure manually that it matches to your tensorflow version [here](https://github.com/tensorflow/probability/releases).</small>

* Download this git directory in your Python path such that `import deephedging.world` works.
* Open `notebooks/trainer.ipynb` and run it. 

### Anaconda

In your local conda environment use the following:
        
        conda install "cdxbasics>=0.2.11" -c hansbuehler
        conda install -c conda-forge tensorflow>=2.10
        conda install -c conda-forge tensorflow-probability==0.14
        conda install cvxpy

At the time of writing, this gives you TensowFlow 2.10 and the correct `tensorflow-probability` version 0.14. 
Then check that the following works:
                
        import tensorflow as tf
        import tensorflow_probability as tfp # ensure this does not fail
        print("TF version %s. Num GPUs Available: %ld" % (tf.__version__, len(tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU')) ))  # should give you the tenosr flow version and whether it found any GPUs

### AWS SageMaker

(29/1/2023) Finally AWS SageMaker supports TensorFlow 2.10 with and without GPU with the conda environment `conda_tensorflow2_p310`. It is still pretty buggy (e.g. conda is inconsistent out of the box) but seems to work. AWS tends to change their available conda packages, so check which one is available when you are trying this.

In order to run Deep Hedging, launch a decent AWS SageMaker instance such as `ml.c5.2xlarge`.
Open a terminal and write:
        
        bash
        conda activate tensorflow2_p310
        python -m pip install --upgrade pip
        pip install cdxbasics tensorflow_probability==0.14 cvxpy

The reason we are using `pip` here an not `conda` is that `conda_tensorflow2_p310` is inconsistent, so using `conda` is pretty unreliable and very slow. Either way, above should give you an environemnt with Tensorflow 2.10, including with GPU support if your selected instance has GPUs.

If you have cloned the [Deep Hedging git directory](https://github.com/hansbuehler/deephedging) via SageMaker, then the `deephedging` directory is <i>not</i> in your include path, even if the directory shows up in your jupyter hub file list. _Don't ask..._ That is why I've added some magic code on top of the various noteooks:

    import os
    p = os.getcwd()
    dhn = "/deephedging"
    i = p.find(dhn)
    if i!=-1:
        p = p[:i]
        import sys
        sys.path.append(p)
        print("SageMaker: added python path %s" % p)

### GPU support

In order to run on GPU you must have installed the correct CUDA and cuDNN drivers, see [here](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/source#gpu). This seems to have been done on AWS. 
Once you have identified the correct drivers, use

        conda install -c conda-forge cudatoolkit=11.2 cudnn=8.1
        
The notebooks in the git directory will print the number of available CPUs and GPUs.

The latest version of Deep Hedging _will_ benefit quite a bit from the presence of a GPU if large batch sizes are used. For example `notebooks/trainer-recurrent-fwdstart.ipynb` experiences a speed up from just above 1 hour to less than 30mins on a `p3.2xlarge` as opposed to a `c5.4xlarge`.

## Industrial Machine Learning Code Philosophy

We attempted to provide a base for industrial code development.
* **Notebook-free**: all code can, and is meant to, run outside a jupyter notebook. Notebooks are good for playing around but should not feature in any production environment. Notebooks are used for demonstration only.

* **Config-driven built**:
        avoids differences between training and inference code. In both cases, the respective model hierarchy is built
        driven by the structure of the config file. There is no need to know for inference which sub-models where used during training within the overall model hierarchy.          


* **Robust configs**  all configurations of all objects are driven by dictionaries.
    However, the use of simple dictionaries leads to a number of inefficiencies which can slow down development.
    We therefore use [`cdxbasics.config.Config`](https://github.com/hansbuehler/cdxbasics) which provides:
    
    * **Automatic cast'ing and basic range checks**: apply basic checks upon reading parameters from a `config`, for example

            from cdxbasics.config import Config, Int, Float
            def create_agent( config : Config ):
                style    = config("style", "fast_forward", ['fast_forward', 'recurrent', 'iterative'], "Network style")
                smooth   = config("smooth", 0.1, (Float > 0.) & (Float <= 1.), "Smoothing factor")
                width    = config.network("width",  20, Int>0,  "Width of the network")
                depth    = config.network("depth",  3,  Int>0,  "Depth of the network")
                config.done()
                
    *  **Self-documentation**: once parsed by receving code, the config is self-documenting and is able to print out any values used, including those which were not set by the users when calling the receiving code.

            config = Config()
            config.style = "recurrent"
            config.network.width = 100                
            create_agent( config ) 
            print( config.usage_report(with_cast=True) )    

        yields

            config.network['depth'] = 3 # (int>0) Depth of the network; default: 3
            config.network['width'] = 100 # (int>0) Width of the network; default: 20
            config['smooth'] = 0.1 # (float>0.0 and float<=1.0) Smoothing factor; default: 0.1
            config['style'] = recurrent # ([ fast_forward, recurrent, iterative ]) Network style; default: fast_forward

    * **Catching spelling Errors**: ensures that any config parameter is understood by the receving code. Here is what happens if we misspell `width` in our previous example:

            config = Config()
            config.style = "recurrent"
            config.network.witdh = 100
                
            create_agent( config ) 
            print( config.usage_report(with_cast=True) )  

        prodcues

            Error closing 'config.network': the following config arguments were not read: ['witdh']

            Summary of all variables read from this object:
            config.network['depth'] = 3 # Depth of the network; default: 3
            config.network['width'] = 20 # Width of the network; default: 20
            # 
            config['smooth'] = 0.1 # Smoothing factor; default: 0.1
            config['style'] = recurrent # Network style; default: fast_forward

    * **Unique Identifiers**: `Config` objects can produce a `unique_id()` which identifies the 
        specific configuration uniquely. This can be used as key for caching strategies.

    * **Object notation**: we prefer using one-line member notation `config.network.nSamples = 2` instead of the standard dictionary notation `config['network'] = dict(nSamples = 2)`.

        

* **Defensive programming**: validate as many inputs to functions as reasonable with clear, actionable, context-dependent error messages. We use the `cdxbasics.logger` framework with a similar usage paradigm as C++ `ASSSERT`/`VERIFY`.


## Key Objects and Functions

*  **world.SimpleWorld_Spot_ATM** class

    Simple World with either plan Black & Scholes dynamics, or with one asset and one floating ATM option. The asset has stochastic volatility, and a mean-reverting drift. The implied volatility of the asset is not the realized volatility, allowing to re-create some results from https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.11948 

    * Set the `black_scholes` boolean config flag to `True` to turn the world into a simple Black & Scholes world, with no traded option.
    * Use `no_stoch_vol` to turn off stochastic vol, and `no_stoch_drift` to turn off the stochastic mean reverting drift of the asset.
    If both are True, then the market is Black & Scholes, but the option can still be traded for hedging.

    See `notebooks/simpleWorld_Spot_ATM.ipynb`
    
*  **gym.VanillaDeepHedgingGym**  class

    Main Deep Hedging training gym (the Monte Carlo). It will create internally the agent network and the monetary utility $U$ (practically, it will also compute the monetary utility for the playoff alone at the same time).
    
    To run the models for all samples of a given `world` use `r = gym(world.tf_data)`.
    The returned dictionary contains the following members
    
    * `utility (:,)` primary objective to maximize, per path.
    * `utility0 (:,)` objective without hedging, per path. `utility0` also needs to be learned if an OCE monetary utility is used
    * `loss (:,)` the loss `-utility-utility0` per path.
    * `payoff (:,)` terminal payoff per path.
    * `pnl (:,)` mid-price pnl of trading (e.g. ex cost) per path.
    * `cost (:,)` aggregate cost of trading per path.
    * `gains (:,)` total gains: `payoff + pnl - cost` per path. 
    * `actions (:,M,N)` actions taken, per step, per path, $M$ steps and $N$ instruments.
    * `deltas (:,M,N)` deltas, per step, per path: `deltas = np.cumsum(actions,axis=1)`.
    
   The core loop in `VanillaDeepHedgingGym.call()` is only about 200 lines of code. It is recommended to read it before using the framework.

*  **trainer.train()**  function

    Main Deep Hedging training engine (stochastic gradient descent). 
    Trains the model using Keras. Any optimizer supported by Keras might be used. When run in a Jupyer notebook the model will dynamically plot progress in a number of live updating graphs.
    * When training outside jupyer, set `config.train.monitor_type = "none"` (or write your own).
    * See `notebooks/trainer.ipynb` as an example.
    * The `train()` function is barely 50 lines. It is recommended to read it before using the framework.
    
       
    


## Interpreting Progress Graphs

Here is an example of progress information printed by  `NotebookMonitor`:

![progess example](pictures/progress.png)

The graphs show:

* (1): visualizing convergence
    
    * (1a): last 100 epochs loss view on convergence: initial loss, full training set loss with std error, batch loss, validation loss, and the running best fit.
    
    * (1b): loss across all epochs, same metrics as above.
    
    * (1c): learned utility for the hedged payoff, last 100 epochs.
    
    * (1d): learned utility for the unhedged payoff, last 100 epochs.

    * (1e): memory usage
    
* (2) visualizing the result on the training set:
    
    * (2a) for the training set shows the payoff as function of terminal spot, the hedge, and the overall gains i.e. payoff plus hedge less cost. Each of these is computed less their monetary utility, hence you are comparing terminal payoffs which have the same initial monetary utility.

    * (2b) visualizing terminal payoffs makes sense for European payoffs, but is a lot less intuitive for more exotic payoffs. Hence, (2b) shows the same data is (2a) but
    it adds one stddev for the value of the payoff for a given terminal spot.

    * (2c) shows the utility for payoff and gains by percentile for the training set. Higher is better; the algorithm
    is attempting to beat the total expected utility which is the left most percentile. In the example we see that the gains process dominates the initial payoff in all percentiles.
    
    * (2a', 2b', 2c') are the same graphs but for the validation set 
    
* (3, 4) visualize actions:
    
    * (3a) shows  actions per time step: blue the spot, and orange the option.
    * (3b) shows the aggregated action as deltas accross time steps. Note that the concept of "delta" only makes sense if the instrument is actually the same per time step, e.g. spot of an stock price. For floating options this is not a particularly meaningful concept.

    * (4a) shows the average action for the first asset (spot) for a few time steps over spot bins.
    * (4b) shows the avergae delta for the first asset for a a few time steps over spot bins.
    * (4a*) shows the same as (4a), but also showing a one stddev bar around each bin mid-point.
    * (4b*) the same for (4b)

Text information:

* (A) provides information on the number of weights used, whether an initial delta or recurrent weights were used, features used and available, and the utility.

  It also shows the caching path.

* (B) Provides information during training on progress, and an estimate of total time required.

## Misc Code Overview

Core training:    

*  `gym.py` contains the gym for Deep Hedging, `VanillaDeepHedgingGym`. It is a small script and it is recommended that every user reads it.

* `train.py` simplistic wrapper around keras `fit()` to train the `gym`. It is a small script and it is recommended that every user reads it.

* `plot_training.py` contains code to provide live plots during training when running in a notebook.

World generator

* `world.py` contains a world generator `SimpleWorld_Spot_ATM`.

Networks

* `layer.py` contains simple variable and dense layers. 

* `agents.py` contains an `AgentFactory` which is creates agents on the fly from a `config`. Only implementation provided is a simple `SimpleDenseAgent`. Construction is driven by `config.gym.agent`. *The recurrent implementation of the agent has not been tested yet*.

* `objectives.py` contains a `MonetaryUtility` which implements a range reasonable objectives Typically driven by `config.gym.objective`.

Tools

* `base.py` contains a number of useful tensorflow utilities such as
      
    * `tfCast, npCast`: casting from and to tensorflow
    * `tf_back_flatten`: flattens a tenosr while keeping the first 'dim'-1 axis the same.
    * `tf_make_dim`: ensures a tensor has a given dimension, by either flattening it at the end, or adding `tf.newaxis`.
    * `mean, var, std, err`: standard statistics, weighted by a density.
    * `mean_bins`: binning by taking the average.
    * `mean_cum_bins`: cummulative binning by taking the average.
    * `perct_exp`: CVaR, i.e. the expecation over a percentile.
    * `fmt_seconds`: format for seconds.
            
* `plot_bs_hedge.py` is used to compare hedging vs the analytical solution in Black & Scholes.
